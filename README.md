# Bridging Theory, Research, and Computational Skills for Transforming Chemistry Education: Repository

Welcome to the "Bridging Theory, Research, and Computational Skills for Transforming Chemistry Education" computational practices repository! This repository contains all the code, exercises, and resources developed during the course. Whether you're a student looking to solidify your understanding, a researcher exploring new tools, or simply someone curious about the intersection of education, research, and programming, this repository offers a comprehensive guide to implementing and understanding key concepts.

This repository is organized into practices, each representing a significant concept (or group of related concepts)taught during the course.
Youâ€™ll find:

- **Step-by-step tutorials**: Detailed explanations for each practice.
- **Code examples**: Python scripts covering various computational techniques.
- **Visualizations**: Graphics and plots to help understand complex topics.
- **Instructions for free tools and databases**: Learn how to access and use industry-standard resources.

We encourage you to dive in and explore the materials!  
- **Learn by doing**: Reinforce theoretical knowledge through practical coding tasks.  
- **Expand your skills**: Develop valuable programming skills relevant to real-world applications.

Don't hesitate to adapt, experiment, and expand upon these practices. The best way to learn is by trying it yourself!

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up your local environment and start exploring the practices.  

### Step 1: Prerequisites  
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or later  
- **Conda**: Version 4.11 or later  
- **Git**: Version 2.30 or later

### Step 2: Clone the Repository  
To download the repository locally, open your terminal and run:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com  
cd --  
```
### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend using `Conda` to create an isolated environment for this project

1. Create a new environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name chem_practices python=3.9
   ```
2. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate chem_practices
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Jupyter-lab
- ASE
- PyXtal
- Wulffpack
